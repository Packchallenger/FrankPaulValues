<h2>What is FrankPaulValues?</h2>
    <p>FrankPaulValues is a political quiz inspired by <a href="https://8values.github.io/">8values,</a> but tailored to the political climate of the United States Political Simulator which is a discord server. FrankPaulValues tries to be a more complete indicator of what politics people follow. This is paticularly helpful for new members which don't know what party to join.</p>

<h2>What are the Frank Paul Values?</h2>
    <p>There are six independent axes - Economics, Perspective, Government, Welfare, Drugs, and Compassion - and each has two opposing values assigned to them. They are:</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#0288d1;">Planned</b> (Economics)<br/>
        Those with higher Planned scores believe the economy should be planned by the government to reduce exploitation from corporations.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#d32f2f;">Free Market</b> (Economics)<br/>
        Those with higher Free Market scores believe that corporations are the backbone of the economy.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#D15585;">Progressive</b> (Perspective)<br/>
        Those with higher Progressive scores often follow values which tend to be much more accepting of communities such as the LGBTQ community and often encourage the BLM movement.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#fbc02d;">Conservative</b> (Perspective)<br/>
        Those with higher Conservative scores belive in values which tend to be more traditional such as the nuclear family and marriage.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#7CD1FF;">Safety</b> (Government)<br/>
        Those with higher Safety scores believe that safety is more important than being free, they often say you cannot be free if you are not safe.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#f57c00;">Liberty</b> (Government)<br/>
        Those with higher Liberty scores believe that liberty is the foundation of ethics and thus you are not safe if you are not free.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#00796b;">Expand</b> (Welfare)<br/>
        Those with higher Expand scores believe the government should spend more money on government programs which often require high taxation.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#303f9f;">Reduce</b> (Welfare)<br/>
        Those with higher Reduce scores believe the government should lower taxes and usually oppose welfare.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#7b1fa2;">Emphathetic</b> (Drugs)<br/>
        Those with higher Emphathetic scores believe that drug consumption is a cause of poverty and are kinder to addicts.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#689f38;">Condemn</b> (Drugs)<br/>
        Those with higher Condemn scores believe that drugs are bad, they oppose legalization of drugs and look down upon addicts.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#a6a6a6ff;">Compassionate</b> (Compassion)<br/>
        Those with higher Compassionate scores often want to do more to make life less hard.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#30CC86;">Iron Fist</b> (Compassion)<br/>
        Those with higher Iron Fist scores believe that poverty should simply be more escapble instead of less hard.</p>
<h2>What's the "Closest Match" mean at the bottom of the results?</h2>
    <p>In addition to matching you to the twelve Frank Paul Values, the quiz also attempts to match you to a political ideology. Don't take it too seriously.</p>
<h2>I don't like my scores!</h2>
